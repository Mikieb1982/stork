## Setup & Usage

1.  **Populate `names.json`:** This is the most crucial step. The `names.json` file needs to be filled with a large dataset of names following the established JSON structure (see `index.html` script for the expected fields: `id`, `name`, `language`, `gender`, `meaning`, `originNotes`, `pronunciation`, `popularity`, `lengthCategory`, `styleScore`).
2.  **File Placement:** Ensure all files and folders are placed according to the structure above. The `blog` folder and `assets` folder should be at the same root level as `index.html` and `blog.html`.
3.  **Web Server:** To enable the `fetch` request for `names.json` and avoid potential CORS issues, run these files from a local web server or deploy them to a web hosting provider. Simply opening `index.html` directly from your file system might prevent the data from loading.
4.  **Open `index.html`:** Access the `index.html` file through your web server in a browser.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
    * Tailwind CSS Framework
* JavaScript (Vanilla)
    * DOM Manipulation
    * Event Handling
    * `localStorage` for Favorites
    * `fetch` API (for loading `names.json` - *currently using embedded sample data for preview*)
